My name is Giorgia Shields, and I am a Ph.D. student studying Sociology at Northeastern University in Boston, MA. 

### Biography

I grew up in Auburn, Alabama. Prior to landing in Boston (for now), I also lived in Athens, GA; Atlanta, Ga; Austin, TX; and Long Beach, CA. I have a master's degree in Women's and Gender Studies from the University of Texas at Austin, and a bachelor's degree in Sociology from Georgia State University. Other than academics, I love fantasy novels, plants, and old books on antiquated social norms.

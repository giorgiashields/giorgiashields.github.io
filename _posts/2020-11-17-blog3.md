In this post, I continue exploring text analysis through “My Twisted World,” the manifesto released by Elliot Rodger prior to his deadly 2014 rampage in Isla Vista, CA. This text was introduced in my last post, [here](https://giorgiashields.github.io/2020-11-09-Blog2/).<br/><br/>

While continuing to focus on text analysis as an exploratory approach to sociological research, this week’s post explores the Rodger text through topic modeling. Topic modeling is an unsupervised machine learning technique that uses natural language processing to identify themes in a given text. To do this, I’m using the jsLDA In-browser topic modeling tool created by David Mimno, which can be accessed [on his website](https://mimno.infosci.cornell.edu/jsLDA/). This tool allows the user to choose the number of iterations run (by intervals of 50), as well as to choose the number of topics returned. By adjusting the number of topics run, the user can assess and refine the salience of the results. The topics returned are represented by a cluster of words that appear together frequently and are identified as thematically connected, which the jsLDA tool allows the user to click on in order to display passages featuring that topic or theme.</br></br>

Typically, the researcher would choose the number of topics returned based on careful assessment and tweaking, to ensure the models are relatively exhaustive and without overlap. However, because of the exploratory nature of this endeavor, I found that adjusting the number of topics returned more useful. For example, while I found that fewer than 20 topics produced less content overlap (particularly with the number of topics featuring "girls"), training with over 20 topics brought up some interesting themes that may have been otherwise subsumed within broader topics. Regardless of topic number, I ran 200 iterations each time.</br></br>

Predictably, as mentioned, girls and sex were a reoccuring theme. After testing different numbers of topics, I found training 9 topics returned the two most salient "girl" topics. One, "didn't girls were about had like thought how even just," returns passages that primarily express the nascence of his fear of rejection by girls, and thus his hopelessness and bitter resentment about sexual relationships.

<div align="center"><font size= 1>Topic: "didn't girls were about had like thought how even just" </font></div></br></br>


In contrast, the topic “life sex girls such how never like women could i've” returns passages in which it is apparent that Rodger's beliefs about women and sexuality have now been fully-formed. These beliefs and conclusions are well-encompassed by the statement pictured, that "[t]he ultimate evil behind sexuality is the human female."

<div align="center"><font size= 1>Topic: “life sex girls such how never like women could i've”</font></div></br></br>


It's possible that without these models, the subtle but analytically useful distinction between the perspectives Rodger writes from within each topic might be easy to overlook. Alternatively, given the length of the text and the meandering nature of the writing, it would also be easy to get lost in the process of attempting to classify a multiplicity of topics around these themes. </br></br>

In addition to the topics we might expect to find in a text like this, some were also less obvious. Running 200 iterations on 20 models, I found and was particularly struck by the topic “had could way over lottery didn’t become give still win,” which returns passages in which Rodger focuses on his desire to win the lottery. I find this interesting, particularly where Rodger claims to be playing the lottery because he “was so desperate to live a satisfying life.”

<div align="center"><font size= 1>Topic: “had could way over lottery didn’t become give still win” </font></div></br></br>


From a sociological perspective, this obsession highlights a tie between capitalism and misogyny that might have been otherwise easy to overlook in this text, particularly considering that Rodger came from a relatively affluent background. Additionally, Rodger's focus on winning the lottery, rather than seeking career success, may point to the larger sense of entitlement (that is, beyond entitlement to women) that pervades (typically white) masculinist thought.</br></br>

Another interesting topic that emerged regardless of the number of topics trained was “games play game had played playing fun over cyber planet” (there is variation in the representative words depending on the number of topics), which returns passages focused around video games, though it also includes other types of games. I thought this was interesting because of the common stereotypical association of gamers with misogynistic worldviews. As a starting point for sociological speculation, reading the passages returned from this topic suggests that this is potentially a spurious relationship, rather than a causal one. It is apparent based on the passages below that World of Warcraft and other games provided a social network and sense of belonging that Rodger did not have prior access to.

Considering this, might there be a larger sense of social alienation that can, at times, drive both enthusiastic gaming *and* misogynistic opinon? Relatedly, is it possible that young male gamers are socialized into misogyny because of the insular, gender-segregated nature of gaming communities, not because this thinking is endemic to gamers but rather because the pressure to fit in is overwhelming? If so, this may have implications for considering the possibilies and strategies of antifeminist deradicalization, among other topics.</br></br>

This has just been a brief foray into the world of topic modeling, but this post builds on my last as I continue to consider the possibilities of computational text analysis for sociologial research.
